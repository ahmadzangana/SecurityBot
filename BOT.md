# BOT

### Use Cases: (Same as Before)  

Our bot will aid users while performing the following tasks:

1. Check security vulnerabilities of an application when bot is integrated with the repo for the first time
    1. __Preconditions__  
    The repo must have the security bot installed.
    2. __Main Flow__  
     Github signals the bot to check the code present in the repository against any potential vulnerabilities. Bot fetches the code from the repository and runs OWASP ZAP and static analysis tools [S1]. Bot will collect the list of vulnerabilities and raise an issue with the vulnerabilities found [S2].
    3. __Subflows__  
    [S1] - The tools will be picked according to the programming language or framework used.
    [S2] - The issue will be raised with title as <type_of_vulnerability>.
    4. __Alternative Flows__  
    If no vulnerabilities are found, the bot comments that no vulnerability is detected in the code.

2. A developer wants to see all the vulnerabilities introduced in the code because of his commit
    1. __Preconditions__  
     The repo must have the security bot installed.
    2. __Main Flow__  
     One of the developers commits a piece of code. Github signals the bot with the commit id. Bot fetches the code from the commit and runs OWASP ZAP and static analysis tools [S1]. Bot will collect the list of vulnerabilities and post a comment on the commit with the new vulnerabilities found because of it. It also raises an issue with the vulnerabilities found [S2].
    3. __Subflows__  
     [S1] - The tools will be picked according to the programming language or framework used.
     [S2] - The issue will be raised with title as <type_of_vulnerability>.
    4. __Alternative Flows__  
     If no vulnerabilities are found, the bot comments that no vulnerability is detected in the code.

3. A repo collaborator has to check a pull request for vulnerabilities.
      1. __Preconditions__  
       The repo must have the security bot installed.
      2. __Main Flow__  
       Some contributor raises a pull request [S1]. Github signals the bot with the pull request number. Bot fetches the code from the Pull Request and runs OWASP ZAP and static analysis tools. Bot makes comments on the Pull Request, detailing the new vulnerabilities added because of it.
      3. __Subflows__  
       [S1] - The contributor can raise a pull request from another fork, or from one of the branches in the same repo. The bot will analyze both the base and the branch to be merged, and report any differences.
      4. __Alternative Flows__  
       If no vulnerabilities are found, the bot comments that no vulnerability is detected in the code.

4. Get vulnerability report of the day via email
    1. __Preconditions__  
      The repo must have the security bot installed.
    2. __Main Flow__  
      Bot will query the database and fetch list of vulnerabilities from past 5 commits. It sends out an email stating the vulnerabilities found.
    3. __Alternative Flows__  
      If no vulnerabilities are found, the bot sends an email that no vulnerability is detected in the code.
