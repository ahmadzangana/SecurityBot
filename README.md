### Bot Milestone

#### Documentation for BOT Milestone

The detailed document containing description about the application flow, the design patterns, mocking and selenium testing can be found in [BOT](https://github.com/goeltanmay/SecurityBot/blob/master/BOT.md) page.

#### Instructions to Run the Application

Our complete application is divided into two parts: Server Hosted Bot Application and Local Bot Application. The server hosted bot listens to GitHub events and extracts detail about these events. When a local bot polls to the server bot it delegates the event to local instance. Local instance then runs the penetration testing and returns the set of vulnerabilities as a result to server bot. The server bot raises an issue, comments on push and pull requests, or sends an email depending upon the type of event it received from the GitHUb.

##### Instruction to set up the Server Bot
